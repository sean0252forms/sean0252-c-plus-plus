Pay attention to the character # (hash) at the beginning of the first line. It means that the content of this line is the so-called preprocessor directive. We’re going to tell you more about the preprocessor later, but for now we’ll only say that it’s a separate part of the compiler whose task is to pre-read the text of the program and make some modifications in it. The prefix "pre" suggests that these operations are performed before the full processing (compilation) takes place.

The changes the preprocessor will introduce are fully controlled by its directives. In our program, we are dealing with the include directive. When the preprocessor meets that directive, it replaces the directive with the content of the file whose name is listed in the directive (in our case, this is the file named iostream). The changes made by the preprocessor never modify the content of your source file in any way. Any alterations are made on a volatile copy of your program that disappears immediately after the compiler finishes its work.

So why do need the preprocessor to include the content of a completely unknown file called iostream? Writing a program is similar to building a construction with ready-made blocks. In our program, we are going to use one such block and it will happen when we want to write something on the screen. That block is called cout (you can find it inside our code), but the compiler knows nothing about it so far. In particular, the compiler has no idea that cout is a valid name for that block while cuot isn't. The compiler must be warned about it – it needs to be aware of the fact.

A set of preliminary information that the compiler needs is included in header files. These files contain a collection of preliminary information about ready-made blocks which can be used by a program to write text on the screen, or to read letters from the keyboard. So when our program is going to write something, it will use a block called cout, which is able to do the trick (and much more). We don't want the compiler to be surprised, so we need to warn it about that. The compiler’s developers put a set of this anticipatory information in the iostream file. All we have to do is use the file. This is exactly what we expect from the include directive.

But where is the iostream file located? The answer is simple, but not as clear as you might want: that’s not our problem. The preprocessor knows where it is. Good job, preprocessor!
