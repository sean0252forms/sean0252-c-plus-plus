Your first program
Now we’re going to show you a very simple (and, at the same time, completely useless) program written in the C++ language. We’re going to use this example to present you some basic rules governing the language. The program itself will be modified many times, as it becomes enriched by various additional elements in expanding our programming knowledge. Ready? All right then, let’s go.

First we need to define our expectations for the program. They’ll be very modest. We want a short text to appear on the screen. Let's assume that the text will state:

It's me, your first program.
output

That’s all we want at the moment.

What further steps should our first program perform? Let's try to enumerate them here:

to start;
to write the text on the screen;
to stop
This type of structured and semi-formal description of each step of the program is called an algorithm. Sources of the word algorithm can be traced back to the Arabic language and originated in early medieval times, and for us, this represents the beginning of computer programming.

Now it's time to see our program. It’s on the right side of the screen, in the editor.

It looks a bit mysterious, doesn't it? Let’s check out each line of the program carefully, and uncover its meaning and purpose. The description is not particularly accurate and those of you who know a little C++ already will probably conclude that it’s too simplistic and somewhat childish. We did this on purpose – we’re not building Rome in a day. Not even in a week!

Let's move on.
